I normally avoid making political posts because I don't want to fight. But recently emotions have built up inside me to the extent that I need to express them. So I made a video to express my emotions about illegal immigration.

I graduated from high school in 2008. During senior year - specifically, in October 2007 - we, the students, got our hopes up that the Dream Act might pass, but it did not. The topic of illegal immigration has been close to my mind ever since then and I still feel that we need more enhanced protections for undocumented immigrants, not more deportations.

In case you'd rather just read text instead of watching the video, here's the full text:

DON'T DEPORT MY HIGH SCHOOL CLASSMATES
THE SMARTEST KID IN PHYSICS CLASS
THE FUNNIEST KID IN BAND
THE BEST SINGER IN THE SCHOOL CHOIR
I SEE THOSE CLASSMATES AS BETTER PEOPLE THAN ME, A U.S. CITIZEN.
THEY DESERVE TO LIVE IN THE U.S. AS MUCH AS I DO
I BEG YOU, DON'T DEPORT THEM!
IF YOU DEPORT ALL UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS, YOU WOULD BE DEPORTING...
SOME OF THE BEST PEOPLE THAT I HAVE EVER HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF KNOWING IN MY LIFE.
EVERY DAY THAT I WAS IN SCHOOL, I PUT MY HAND OVER MY HEART AND SWORE ALLEGIANCE TO THE FLAG...
AND TO THIS CONCEPT OF "LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL"
AND MY UNDOCUMENTED CLASSMATES SWORE IT TOO.
IN A FAIR AND "JUST" WORLD, WE WOULD APPRECIATE PEOPLE FOR THE WORK THAT THEY DO.
AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE NOTICED BUT...
A LOT OF UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS HAVE WORKED EXTREMELY HARD.
THEY DESERVE TO BE PROTECTED, NOT DEPORTED.
SOMETIMES THE "RULE OF LAW" AND TRUE JUSTICE ARE NOT THE SAME...
BECAUSE THE LAWS THEMSELVES ARE UNJUST.
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE TIMES.
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING
