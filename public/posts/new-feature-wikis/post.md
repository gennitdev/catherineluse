title: New Multiforum Feature - Wikis

I added a wiki feature. Forum owners can go into the forum settings and select a checkbox to enable the wiki. That turns on a Wiki tab.

Here's an example of a wiki with a single page:

![one-page-wiki-example](/posts/new-feature-wikis/one-page-wiki-example.png)

Here's a wiki with multiple pages - see there's a box that lists other pages:

![multiple-page-wiki-example](/posts/new-feature-wikis/wiki-multiple-pages.png)

Here's how it looks when you edit a wiki page:

![edit wiki example](/posts/new-feature-wikis/edit-wiki-example.png)

Here's how it looks when you edit a wiki page in full screen mode (after clicking the box in the top right of the text editor):

![wiki edit fullscreen](/posts/new-feature-wikis/wiki-edit-fullscreen.png)

If you click 'see edits' you can see the revision history of a wiki page:

![wiki revision history](/posts/new-feature-wikis/wiki-revision-history.png)

If you click a revision you can see the diff that shows what was edited:
