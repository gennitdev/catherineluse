I'm excited to announce a new collaborative feature for Multiforum: community wikis. This addition allows forum owners to create shared knowledge bases where community members can contribute and maintain information together.

## Getting Started with Wikis

Forum owners can enable the wiki feature by navigating to their forum settings and checking the "Enable Wiki" option. Once activated, a new Wiki tab will appear in the forum navigation, giving members easy access to the collaborative documentation space.

## Single Page Wikis

For simpler use cases, wikis can consist of a single page that serves as a centralized information hub:

## Multi-Page Wiki Structure

More complex wikis can be organized into multiple interconnected pages. The interface includes a helpful sidebar that lists all available pages for easy navigation:

## Editing Experience

The wiki editing interface provides a clean, intuitive environment for content creation and modification:

For users who prefer more screen real estate, the editor includes a full-screen mode accessible via the expand button in the top-right corner:

## Version Control and History

One of the most powerful aspects of the wiki system is its built-in revision tracking. Users can view the complete edit history of any page by clicking "see edits":

Each revision can be examined in detail, with a diff view that clearly highlights what content was added, modified, or removed:

This tool can be used to help trace back to the source of an error if needed.
