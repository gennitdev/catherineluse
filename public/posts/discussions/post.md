# Discussions

## Discussion detail page

This screenshot shows how a discussion detail page looks at mobile width, if
you come to it from within the context of an individual forum:

### Discussion list within a forum

A birdwatching forum is an example of a forum that could make use of both in-person events
and online discussions with people who may never attend any events. For example, someone
who takes a picture of an unfamiliar bird in Phoenix might ask the Phoenix birdwatchers what it is.
That's when the Discussions tab within a forum would come in handy:

### Discussion detail

If you click an item in the discussion list, it goes to the discussion detail view, which contains
the comments. In the case of a birdwatching group, maybe there's a comment identifying the bird:

### Forum without any events

Events are optional for forums. I intend to make it possible for a forum to turn
off the events tab. The Discussions tab is the main landing page, especially for forums
that could be focused on technical questions and answers, which would
have no need for events:

### Discussion list views within a forum

Here's the discussion list within a single forum, at mobile width:
