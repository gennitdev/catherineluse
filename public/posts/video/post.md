I made a video walkthrough of Multiforum to explain the project in a problem-and-solution format.

(If I was making a video demo of my project for general purposes, the video would have been two minutes, not 18 minutes. I recorded this because I was applying for a job and they told me they wouldn't consider my application unless I sent them a project demo video first. They rejected my application. But I thought I did a pretty good job of explaining the project here, so I've added it here, just in case something good comes out of it.)
