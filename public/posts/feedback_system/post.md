Multiforum Demo Part 4: How the Feedback System Works

I’m excited to share a new feature in Multiforum: the voting and feedback system. Multiforum is a reddit-like platform where you can create and participate in multiple forums. You can submit posts, vote on them, and now, leave meaningful feedback. Here’s how it works.

The Voting System

The voting system in Multiforum is designed to surface the most relevant and engaging content. Posts and comments can be upvoted, and their ranking depends on a few factors:

Hot: A balance of upvotes and recency determines the ranking.

New: Posts sorted in chronological order.

Top: Posts with the highest weighted upvotes, where votes from older accounts with more reputation carry more weight.

This system ensures that quality content is highlighted while giving weight to the contributions of trusted, long-time users.

The Feedback System

This feature addresses some of the common issues with downvotes on platforms like Reddit. Downvotes can feel ambiguous and discouraging. They’re often misused to express disagreement or worse, to attack specific users. To solve this, Multiforum replaces downvotes with a feedback system.

How Feedback Works

Next to the upvote button, there’s a thumbs-down button, but it’s not a downvote. Clicking it opens a modal where you can type constructive feedback into a text box. You can’t leave the box blank.

This way, if someone doesn’t like your post or comment, you’ll know why. The goal is to turn negative reactions into actionable advice.

Context and Accountability

Feedback is collected on a dedicated page for each post or comment. On this page, you can view all feedback in context.

If feedback is rude or inflammatory, it can be reported just like any other comment.

Mod Profiles

To make feedback less personal and reduce the potential for conflict, feedback is attributed to a semi-anonymous Mod Profile. Every user has two identities:

Regular Username: Used for normal participation.

Mod Profile: A randomly generated identifier (e.g., “Gentle-Parrot-Starlight”) used for moderation actions, including giving feedback.

This serves two purposes:

It allows the person receiving feedback to save face, as they won’t know who gave the feedback.

It ensures accountability, as mod profiles have histories showing all feedback given and other moderation actions.

Feedback vs. Votes

Feedback is not tied to ranking or visibility. It’s a separate tool meant to help authors improve their contributions.

Why It Matters

This system is intended to encourage constructive communication. By replacing ambiguous downvotes with clear feedback, we aim to:

Provide clarity and helpfulness.

Reduce the misuse of negative interactions.

Support authors in improving their posts and comments.

Try It Out

You can start using the new voting and feedback system today. I hope it makes Multiforum a more engaging and thoughtful platform. As always, I’d appreciate hearing your thoughts about these changes.
