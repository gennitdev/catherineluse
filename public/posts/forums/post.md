Hey everyone! I'm excited to share my latest side project with you - a local event finder tool that I've been working on. It's designed to help people find and promote events happening around them. Whether you're a local business owner wanting to attract more customers to your bar or coffee shop, or just someone who wants to share your love for rock music, trivia, or bird watching, this tool should make it easier.

I'll break this into multiple posts, but in this part, we'll explore the forum list features. These allow you to find and navigate forums easily, especially on mobile devices.

Here is the list of forums at mobile width:

The list of forums can be filtered by tag:

The forum list can be filtered by search terms as well:

## Recently visited forums

If you click the menu button on the top left of any page, it shows recently visited forums to support easy context switching.
